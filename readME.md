Hello there! This is hammond bot, because I felt like coding a discord bot one day.
This code has no present errors and running Node . dosen't spit out any, however:
    - THE BOT REFUSES TO FUCKING WORK.
Now I have no idea if this is because i dont have a specific npm package installed but I have no idea how to debug things so \_(-_-)_/
